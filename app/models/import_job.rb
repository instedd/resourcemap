  # :file_uploaded => :pending

  #                            => :finished

  #                        => :canceled_by_user
  #
  # :file_uploaded: a CSV file has been uploaded, but the import process for it hasn't been executed yet.
  # :pending: there's an import job enqueued in Resque waiting to be processed.
  # :in_progress: the import is being processed by the worker.
  # :finished: the import was already processed.
  # :canceled_by_user: the user canceled the import when the job was in status pending. This job will not be processed.

  # :finished_at is nil until the ImportJob reaches the :finished status, when its assigned Time.now
